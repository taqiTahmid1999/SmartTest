2. **NodeJS:**
   - SmartTest requires NodeJS version 16.
   - If you're using NVM, simply run the following command to install NodeJS version 16:
     ```
     nvm install 16
     ```

3. **VS Code:**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from this link: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win).
